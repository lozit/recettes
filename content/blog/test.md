hen in your terminal run `gatsby develop` to start the Gatsby development server. Once the server is running, it will print the address to open for viewing. It’s typically `localhost:8000`. Open that in a browser and you should see the text “Hello World” in the top left corner. Now navigate to `/admin/` - so if your site is at `localhost:8000`, go to `localhost:8000/admin/`. **The trailing slash is required!**
